							<h2>Key concerns</h2>
							<p>In the digital age, people generate massive amounts of data every day. In the face of high technology, the hidden data invisibly controls people's behavior.</p>
							<p>People are immersed in the pleasure that can be readily obtained and gradually lose their personal consciousness.</p>
							<p>As the Internet is supposed to decentralize the power and give everyone a chance to voice out, the current situation shows the opposite. Information processing nowadays needs to collect large amounts of data and the decision making of what can be seen and cannot be seen is purely in the hands of the companies who own the data and algorithms. In this way, our data become their resources to make a profit and even the tool to control us. Digital dictatorship is formed and we as users have no say.</p>
