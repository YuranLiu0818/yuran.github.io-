							<h2>Abstract</h2>
							<p>Maze is an art game which expresses the relationship between "regularity" and ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù.</p>
							<p>The traffic lights in the cross are the ordered brought by regularity.

							The people generating continually and randomly in the maze presents a state of disorder.

							The flow which is the relationship between the speed of people escaping maze and the time is the instant reflection of the system's regularities change.</p>							<p>As the Internet is supposed to decentralize the power and give everyone a chance to voice out, the current situation shows the opposite. Information processing nowadays needs to collect large amounts of data and the decision making of what can be seen and cannot be seen is purely in the hands of the companies who own the data and algorithms. In this way, our data become their resources to make a profit and even the tool to control us. Digital dictatorship is formed and we as users have no say.</p>
							<p>The audience can interact with maze by reorganizing the regularities in the system.

Although the audience's change of regularities is random and disordered, it also will generate a new order in the maze.</p>
